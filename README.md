This is my text based dating simulator !

It's more of a friendship simulator actually , because it's not necessary to win the affection of the characters to "win" the game .
There is a unique ending everytime you reach the maximum affinity for each character ,
so if you've become friends with just one person you've technically already won the game !
The idea is to get multiple endings and maybe even complete them all !
Each character will have different requirements to win their respect and admiration .
Some will want a certain item , need you to say the right thing , or want you to complete another specific task .
You'll be able to travel to different parts of the town to find new people and items to help you on your journey .

That's all ! Welcome to my dating simulator !
