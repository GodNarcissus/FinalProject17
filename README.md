This is my text based dating simulator !

It's more of a friendship simulator actually , because to win the game you don't win the affection of the characters but rather their respect .
There are 7 characters in this version of the game. Befriending all of them will let you win the game!
Each character will have different requirements to win their respect and admiration .
Some will want a certain item , need you to say the right thing , or want you to complete another specific task .
You'll be able to travel to different parts of the town to find new people and items to help you on your journey .

That's all ! Welcome to my dating simulator !
